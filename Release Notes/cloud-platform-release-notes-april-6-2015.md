Online Tools:
Cloud Total Cost of Ownership Tool now open source. The tool has been contributed to the open-source world under the Apache 2 license. Details are available in this blog post (insert link). View the Github repo here.
The goal of the tool is to provide an unbiased apples-to-apples comparison between our offering and selected competitors. It has helped buyers understand what the best value for them might be, even if it’s not CenturyLink. To increase the utility of this app, We’re looking forward to seeing how our customers and partners modify this tool to simplify cloud costs for their own specific scenarios!
Does this sound familiar? We did something similar last month with our Estimator tool.
•	Introducing CenturyLink Cloud Status. This is a portal that allows users to gain insight into the health of the cloud platform, stay in tune with service incidents, and learn about upcoming maintenance. The site address is: http://status.ctl.io. In addition, maintenance and outage notifications will originate from this service. Notifications will no longer come from communications@centurylinkcloud.com , instead they will come from noc@ctl.io. More information can be found HERE. (insert link: https://www.centurylinkcloud.com/knowledge-base/general/centurylink-cloud-status-faq/)
Additionally, there is now a “Status” link that appears in the footer of the CenturyLink Cloud website. This link leads users to the http://ststus.ctl.io page, which provides an overview of the health of the cloud platform, and insight into maintenance and incidents.

•	Activate site. We updated the sign up experience on centurylinkcloud.com to reduce potential fraud, simplify user flow, and make it easier for us to make improvements. Please note that the old activate URL is still online, but will eventually redirect to the new sign up process.
•	Data center-specific Pricing Catalog and Cloud Price Estimator. With the rollout of the new Singapore datacenter, we’ve introduced region-specific pricing. To ensure transparency, we’ve updated our price catalog and estimator tool with a data center-specific dropdown list, to allow users to adjust and view prices accordingly.
